### Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where people not using custom slices were able to save screenshots to FileSystem
but were not able to push them to Prismic.

Fixed a bug that prevented the CLI `prismic sm --setup` command to freeze.

### Migrations

Migration scripts are now run from the builder itself instead of from a `postinstall` script.
