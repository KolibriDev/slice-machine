### Bug fixes

#### Upload images to S3

Users reported 423 errors in their Prismic repository after pushing their slices.
This was due to us storing images as base64 in slice JSON models. We've switched to S3
to securely store them.

If you already pushed slices, note that you will have to push them again.
A `push all` command is on our roadmap already.

#### React dependencies

Some users reported conflicts between the builder dependencies and their (React) project,
causing `Invalid hook calls` errors. We moved most of these dependencies to `dev`.

This should make both downloading and publishing the package a bit faster too ✌️

#### RichText options

Fixed `RichText` field options for ordered and unordered lists.
