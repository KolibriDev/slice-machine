### We now support slice variations! ✌️

You can see variations as a folder of slices of a certain type (eg. Headers) or as
a "default" section with optional layouts and/or fields.

Each of them comes with its own thumbnail that can be previewed in the Prismic writing room.
They also come with their own stories and their mocks can also be configured separately!

To customise the thumbnails, create a folder named after the variation ID and put your
`preview.png` file. Something like: `slices/MySlice/default-variation/preview.png`

### We now support custom types! 🎉

Yes! You can now create/update custom types from the local builder.

This should remove some back and forth between the local builder and the writing room:
mainly, you can now define which slice should be included in the custom type SliceZone.
Pushing the custom type to Prismic will also save and push all linked slices!

To customise custom types thumbnails, create a `index.png` file in each CT folder eg. `customtypes/homepage/index.png`.

If you were connected to your Prismic api endpoint when you loaded this page, your existing custom types
have been downloaded and save in your project. Check them out!

#### Also

- · We added the (much requested) Content Relationship field
- · Libraries index files (eg. `slices/index.js`) are now regenerated after each save
- · Generated mocks and stories are now stored in `.slicemachine/assets`
- · Various fixes, a bit more stability (we're not there yet!)

#### Migration

When you launched the new builder, we ran a migration over your content: all mocks and stories
have been moved to `.slicemachine/assets`. This may break the first render of Storybook. If that's the case
for you, try to manually save slices that have any issue. If your mocks & stories aren't modified between saves,
check that the files have been correctly migrated!
